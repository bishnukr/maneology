              advertising, and social media or content cookies. Cookies make
              your browsing experience better by allowing the website to
              remember your actions and preferences (such as login and region
              selection). This means you don’t have to re-enter this information
              each time you return to the site or browse from one page to
              another. Cookies also provide information on how people use the

              The length of time that a cookie remains on your computer or

              persistent cookies last until they expire or are deleted. Most of
              the cookies we use are persistent and will expire between 30
              minutes and two years from the date they are downloaded to your
              device.

              You can control and manage cookies in various ways. Please keep in
