                Before sending the product back, make sure that the goods are in
                the same condition as they were when shipped out. We will not
                accept any products that have been used or altered (washed, cut,
                or brushed in the case of curly or wavy hair).

                Please make an unboxing video of the package you receive to
                claim any physical damage or missing product. Make sure to
                record the video before opening the courier seal, so that it
                shows the true status of the products. Returns/exchanges on
                claims of damage or defective products will only be accepted
                with the valid video proof.
