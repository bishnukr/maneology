              DO HAIR EXTENSIONS DAMAGE MY NATURAL HAIR?
            </h3>
            <p style={{ marginTop: "10px", margin: "30px 20px" }}>
              Let’s begin with the most common question you all have in your
              mind. The correct answer is no, hair extensions will not damage
              your hair if they are worn properly and are cared for well.
              Maneology is kind to your natural hair, causing absolutely no
              damage (don’t worry girls, we understand your concerns. One use
              and you will adore hair extensions just as much as we do!

              WHAT ARE THE CARE INSTRUCTIONS FOR MY HAIR EXTENSIONS?{" "}
            </h4>
            <p style={{ marginTop: "10px", margin: "30px 20px" }}>
              One major thing to always remember is that your hair extensions do
              not have a natural source of hydration, like your own hair, so it
              is important to keep them moisturized to prolong their lifespan.
            </p>
            <p style={{ marginTop: "10px", margin: "30px 20px" }}>
              -On average, clip-on hair extensions can be washed after 10 to
              15-time wear.
            </p>
            <p style={{ marginTop: "10px", margin: "30px 20px" }}>
              -Since your hair extensions aren’t getting the oils produced by
              your scalp, there is no need to wash them as often.
            </p>
            <p style={{ marginTop: "10px", margin: "30px 20px" }}>
              -After removing your clip-in hair extensions, always ensure to
              detangle the hair and all of the clips are closed shut.

              For Maneology, you can use any mild shampoo and conditioner that

              A piece that boosts your confidence and amps up your look doesn’t

              as possible and must feel just like real, natural hair within no
