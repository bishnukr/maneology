    title: "WILL HAIR EXTENSIONS DAMAGE MY HAIR?",
    desc: "The application style and the type of hair extensions play a significant role when it comes to hair extensions. While permanent hair extensions can cause damage due to the bonding, glueing, and pulling on the hair. Clip-in hair extensions do not damage your hair as they are clipped into your hair like any regular hair clip. Moreover, you should not sleep with the extensions clipped on or wearing them for long stretches of time, this reduces the amount of pulling and stress on your hair, which results in healthier hair. Clip-in hair extensions will cause merely no damage to your hair.",

    title: "WHAT IS REMY HUMAN HAIR?",
    desc: "Remy hair is considered to be the finest quality of human hair because the cuticles are kept intact and not stripped, like in most other non-remy hair extensions. Preserving the hairs’ cuticles and aligning them in a unidirectional fashion creates extensions that are completely natural in appearance. This process ensures that the hair remains super soft, shiny, silky and completely tangle-free throughout its lifetime.",

Remember, the less you wash your extensions, the longer they will last you.",
